 # Collected infos about c++ Wrapper
 For C++ however, the wrapper is a collection of instructions and examples on how to use the AML.Engine.dll, not actual code with which other software interfaces.  

 The C++ wrapper instructions shall explain how to use the AML.Engine.dll in C++ projects running on devices with the .NET Framework version 4.7 or 4.8 installed. It explains the usage with the Microsoft C++ Compiler and optionally also for the GNU C++ compiler.  

 The C++ wrapper is not code but a list of instructions and examples on how to compile C++ code which uses the AML.Engine.dll. These instructions are available for the Microsoft C++ Compiler, GCC support is optional. They consist of a list of compiler settings. Usage examples will also be provided.  

 The C++ wrapper documentation has no architectural model, because it is only a documentation and not a software project.

# /LF10/C++ Functions  
The C++ wrapper should enable developers to use all the functions of the AML.Engine.dll in their C++ project

# /LF20/C++ usability
