# C++ Wrapper
## Introduction
The C++ wrapper instructions shall explain how to use the AML.Engine.dll in 
C++ projects running on devices with the .NET Framework version 4.7 or 4.8
 installed. It explains the usage with the Microsoft C++ Compiler and optionally
 also for the GNU C++ compiler.  
It should provide information to a developer for building a C++ project which uses the AML.Engine.dll.

In the best case scenario, it would have worked with both compilers.
Unfortunately this was not possible to achieve. Therefor the wrapper instructions is build on top of the microsoft compiler tools.
However, all findings for compiling the AML.Engine.dll library with the GNU C++ compiler is listed at the bottom.

At the last point, there is a glossary for common used terms in this project.
